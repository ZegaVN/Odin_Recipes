        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br>
        I go to my local Mexican Market and buy "pollo para asar" which translates to "chicken to grill." 
        This chicken is seasoned and ready to grill. These delicious tacos are easy to make and topped with cilantro and onions. 
        I serve them with guacamole, salsa and fresh lime wedges on the side.
